### About Me
I am a Software Engineer that specializes in full-stack web development and game programming. I received my
education in computer science at George Mason University, App Academy, and through self-study.

What defines me most as a programmer is my focus on creating modular and extensible code.
Beyond that, I enjoy finding the most efficient solutions to the problems I work on, and will not
stop working a LeetCode challenge until it's in the top ~1% of accepted solutions. When I work on a new project,
I always try to utilize a new technology or framework to keep myself improving.

In my spare time, I enjoy creating small indie games wherein I implement some novel idea. My other hobbies
include typical nerd affair like playing games, hiking, and fitness.

If you would like to know more about any of my projects, please reach out to me through e-mail or on LinkedIn.
